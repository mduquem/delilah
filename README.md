# Delilah Resto

### Online order & delivery API

Delilah resto is the third project for acamica's full stack web development career.
It features users, products, and orders entities as objects in a traditional REST API + MySql database.

You would need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) first in order to run this package.

To run locally please clone this repository and run the following next commands:

    npm install && npm run dev

This will get the docker container to run the database server and connect it to our API.

If you want to connect to the database through a MySql client, you can do it with the following credentials:

    MYSQL_DATABASE: 'db'
    MYSQL_USER: 'user'
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: 'password'
